# Big Data: Sentiment Analysis using Common Crawl and AWS

The objectives of this project are:

-  Use the AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) platform to run a series of Hadoop Streaming jobs that will collect 
large amounts of smartphone-related web pages from a massive repository of web data called the Common Crawl. 
- Conduct a broad-based web sentiment analysis to gain insight into the attitudes toward the devices.
